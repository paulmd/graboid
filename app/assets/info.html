	<b>What does this app do?</b><br />
	Graboid records a copy of the data on a MIFARE contactless smart card and stores it on the phone.
	Using the data stored on the phone, it is then possible to restore <i>the same</i> card to it's previous state.
	<br /><br />

	<b>What this app doesn't do?</b><br />
	You can not use Graboid to make a copy of one card and transfer it to <i>another</i> card.
	<br /><br />
	
	<b>What about keys?</b><br />
	Before using Graboid to record and restore a card, the app has to be configured to use a set of MIFARE keys. 
	<br /> <br />
	
	Keys are imported from key files with the *.gkeys extension. Search for key files on the Internet or create your own.
	<br /> <br />
	
	The key files are plain text files containing the two keys (A and B), separated by a space. 
	One sectors key pair per line.
	<br /> <br />
	
	<b>Warning</b><br />
	Please use Graboid responsibly. Using a restored MIFARE card <i>might</i> be illegal in certain circumstances.
	<br /> <br />
